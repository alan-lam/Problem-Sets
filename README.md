# Problem-Sets

Problems from WIC's (Women In Computing) Beginner Programming Competition solved using Racket (and functional programming principles as best as possible)

Most - if not all - modifications are made to make the problem easier to solve using only functional-style programming - or what my understanding of it is anyways. Because functional programming is still a little unfamiliar to me. As such, the level of difficulty will drastically change and will be reflected through something like [hard/easy].

Level of difficulty is an indication of how hard it was - for me - to (1) solve the problems without using for/while loops and variables and (2) figure out how to do it in Racket.
