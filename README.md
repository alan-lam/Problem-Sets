# Problem-Sets

Problems from WIC's (Women In Computing) Beginner Programming Competition solved using Racket (and functional programming principles as best as possible)

Most (if not all) modifications are made to make the problem easier to solve using only functional-style programming - or what my understanding of it is anyways. Because functional programming is still a little unfamiliar to me.

Level of difficulty is an indication of how hard it was - for me - to solve the problems without using for/while loops and variables.
