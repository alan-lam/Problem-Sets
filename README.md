# Problem-Sets

Problems from WIC's (Women In Computing) Beginner Programming Competition solved using Racket (and functional programming principles as best as possible)

Most (if not all) modifications are made to make the problem easier to solve using only functional-style programming - or what my interpretation of it is anyways. Because functional programming is still a little unfamiliar to me.
